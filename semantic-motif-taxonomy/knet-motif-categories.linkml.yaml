classes:

  SemanticMotifCategory:
    title: Semantic Motif Category
    description: |
      Root class/container, all the motif categories are subclasses of this.
    abstract: true

  AssociationStrength:
    is_a: SemanticMotifCategory
    title: Association Strength
    description: |
      This branch classifies categories according to the strenght/reliability/significance/etc of the
      gene/concept associations.
      
      We use the annotation 'associationStrength' to assign a strength number to categories that are 
      related to the strength of an association. This value is intended to be inherited by subclasses
      of an ancestor that defines it, and of course it can be overriden by the subclasses.
    abstract: true

  IntraSpecieAssociation:
    is_a: AssociationStrength
    title: Intra-Specie Association
    description: |
      Associations in this category are based on the same specie of the gene that is considered, contrary
      to, eg, homology or sequence similarity.
    abstract: true
    mixin: true
    annotations:
      associationStrength: 1

  CrossSpecieAssociation:
    is_a: AssociationStrength
    title: Intra-Specie Association
    description: |
      Associations in this category are obtained by comparing information in multiple species, eg,
      via homology or sequence similarity.    
    abstract: true
    mixin: true  
    annotations:
      associationStrength: 2

  ComputationallyInferredAssociation:
    is_a: AssociationStrength
    title: Computationally-Inferred Association
    description: |
      associations that were inferred with computational methods such as text mining or knowledge
      graph analysis. This includes methods that are primarily based on knowledge and semantics
      analysis, eg, text mining. We classify other methods, such as homology or gene-set enrichment
      analysis, under biological topic.

      TODO: vague definition, requires clarification. The initial reason to have this class was
      to establish that text mining has less strength than manual annotation, but maybe we could
      remove it and go with `associationStrength`. 
    abstract: true
    mixin: true

  BiologicalTopic:
    is_a: SemanticMotifCategory
    title: Biological Topic-based Association
    description: |
      Categories under this branch are used to qualify a semantic motif association with the kind of
      biological topic, experimental method, bioinformatic evidence etc that justifies the association.
    abstract: true

  Gene2PhenotypeAssociation:
    is_a: BiologicalTopic
    title: Gene-Phenotype Association
    description: |
      A causal association between a gene or gene variants and a phenotype it determines or influences.
    abstract: true
    notes:
      - Initially, we only had gene/trait association, this superclass was added in case we want to make
        a distinction between the two and for the possibility that we have other types of phenotypic characterisation.

  Gene2TraitAssociation:
    is_a: Gene2PhenotypeAssociation
    title: Gene-Trait Association
    description: |
      A causal association between a gene or gene variants and a trait it determines or influences.
      This is usually used to subclass some other category to state that
      the trait association results from the application of some method (eg, text mining, homology).

      experiment.
